## Rhythm AI — Multi-Persona Conversational Companion

### Overview
Rhythm AI is a multi-persona conversational companion designed to explore how structured AI interactions can support reflection, planning, and analytical reasoning through specialized behavioral personas.

---

### Concept & Objective
The system was designed to improve user task clarity, reduce cognitive overload, and enhance decision efficiency by structuring AI responses into distinct personas aligned with different thinking modes and work contexts.

---

### System Design
Designed and implemented a modular multi-persona architecture consisting of:

- **Kripa** — Reflective dialogue and journaling-oriented interactions  
- **Neev** — Strategic planning and structured thinking support  
- **Lavish** — Analytical reasoning and pattern evaluation  

The project explores adaptive dialogue patterns to simulate varied cognitive styles and interaction behaviors.

### Tech Stack
- Framer (Interface / Experience Layer)  
- n8n (Workflow & Interaction Automation)  
- ElevenLabs (Voice Synthesis / Speech Output)  
- AI / Prompt Logic  
- Python / Logic Layer  

---

### How It Works
User inputs are processed through persona-specific logic that conditions response style and behavior.

n8n workflows orchestrate interaction handling, while Framer provides the interface layer. ElevenLabs is integrated to generate natural-sounding voice responses, enabling spoken conversational feedback.
